# Analysis of Life Expectancy
An analysis of life expectancy using R - the code used in the project can be found at the bottom of the writeup (I did not include the code used to clean the datasets). A link to the presentation can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIGZWnfB5I8">here</a>. Please note that this is not comprehensive and should be used as a baseline for future research. Done May 2023 as a project for the Stat 21400 course at Hunter College.
